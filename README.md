### Hello!!

If you are looking here maybe you are searching to much!! \#:()

The plan its to use this repo to write about all the concepts that I don't 
understand (for now) and use some technique to learn it better.

Recently I am all about the Feynman Learning Technique, so lets see how this 
goes. 

Feynam method:
1. Choose a concept you want to learn about.
2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6.
3. Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better 
   understand it.
4. Review and simplify (optional)

My method:

1. Write all the questions that I have about the subject.
2. Research about all this questions and learn.
3. Explain to someone ( maybe write about it here its enough ).
4. Make a little project/exercises to see the progress.
5. Review and simplify ( AND PUT IT ON THE BLOG For fucks sake ).

I hope this works! If you have more ideas please contact me!
